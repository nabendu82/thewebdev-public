Welcome to part-3 of the series. This part we will start by creating a simple firefox extension, which will show a browser notification every one hour. We are calling it **Please Stand Up.**

So, go ahead and open your code editor and inside a folder create a **manifest.json** file.

Write the below content inside the file. You might have noticed that it is quite similar to the **manifest.json** file, which we had created in [part-1](https://medium.com/@nabendu82/creating-firefox-browser-extensions-1-a48d2753f3d8). The only difference is that we have **browser_action** also, which we are going to use soon in **background.js** file.

Also, create a folder **icons** and place a file **icon.png** inside it.

![icon.png](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/FirefoxAddons/3/2_R2H7guKCv.png)*icon.png*

Create a new file **background.js** and add the below content in it. Now, this is a quite familiar code. We are first creating an alarm, which fires every 60 minutes. There is a listener code, which shows the notification and get’s the random quote from getRandom().

Also, there is a listener to clear the notification by clicking on it.

![background.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/FirefoxAddons/3/3_GVdiZeJSR.png)*background.js*

The simple extension is complete, so it’s time to publish it in the mozilla addon store. I will follow the procedure, which i had explained in [part-2](https://medium.com/@nabendu82/creating-firefox-browser-extensions-2-ddf1f236f401) of this series.

My addon was finally approved and made it to the addon store.

Next, we will start another mozilla extension called **Dev Quotes**. As the name suggests, it will send motivating quotes to developers every 60 minutes.

So, go ahead and create a folder **DevQuotes** and inside it another folder **icons**. Inside that folder place an icon and name it **icon64.png**

![icon](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/FirefoxAddons/3/5_Q15ueln9ph.png)*icon*

Now, create a file **manifest.json** inside the folder **DevQuotes** and put the below content in it. The code is exactly similar to the one **Please Stand Up** as we will be using the same mechanism.

![manifest.json](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/FirefoxAddons/3/6_CNwDR6rVca.png)*manifest.json*

Next, create a file **background.js** and put the below content in it. Notice, that it is exactly the same code as in **Please Stand Up** , only the quotes changed.

<div className={styles.code__block}>

```
    var motivationNotification = 'dev-notification';

    browser.alarms.create('', { periodInMinutes: 60 });

    function getRandom() {
        var quotes = [
            'Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. - Steve Jobs',
            'Good Artists Copy, Great Artists Steal. - Pablo Picasso',
            'Argue with idiots, and you become an idiot. - Paul Graham',
            'Be yourself; everyone else is already taken. - Oscar Wilde',
            'Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. - Leonardo Da Vinci',
            'Changing the world one code at a time. - Unknown',
            'In real open source, you have the right to control your own destiny - Linus Torvalds',
            'Code long and prosper - Unknown',
            'Success is something you attract by the person you become. - Jim Rohn',
            'Why fit in when you were born to stand out? - Dr. Seuss',
            'You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with. - Jim Rohn',
            'If you run around with 9 losers pretty soon you’ll be the 10th loser. - Les Brown',
            'You can change what you are and where you are by changing what goes into your mind. - Zig Ziglar',
            'I think it is possible for ordinary people to choose to be extraordinary. - Elon Musk',
            'Websites promote you 24/7: No employee will do that. - Paul Cookson',
            'First, solve the problem. Then, write the code. - John Johnson',
            'Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute. - Abelson',
            'Programming can be fun, so can cryptography; however they should not be combined. - Kreitzberg',
            'Before software can be reusable it first has to be usable. - Ralph Johnson',
            'Without requirements or design, programming is the art of adding bugs to an empty text file. - Louis Srygley',
            'Java is to JavaScript what Car is to Carpet. - Chris Heilmann'
        ];

    return quotes[Math.floor(Math.random() * Math.floor(quotes.length))];
    }

    browser.alarms.onAlarm.addListener(function (alarm) {
        browser.notifications.create(motivationNotification, {
            type: 'basic',
            iconUrl: browser.extension.getURL('icons/icon64.png'),
            title: 'Dev Quotes',
            message: getRandom()
        });
    });

    browser.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(() => {
        var clearing = browser.notifications.clear(motivationNotification);
        clearing.then(() => {
            console.log('cleared');
        });
    });
```

</div>

Again it the time to publish this simple addon to the mozilla addon store. I will follow the procedure, which i had explained in [part-2](https://medium.com/@nabendu82/creating-firefox-browser-extensions-2-ddf1f236f401) of this series.

I had followed the procedure and submitted the firefox extension and it is **Awaiting Review** now.

![Awaiting Review](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/FirefoxAddons/3/7_BqNg8T_fgE.png)*Awaiting Review*

And the firefox addon was approved and made it way to the mozilla addons site [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/15774633/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/15774633/)

![Dev Quotes](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/FirefoxAddons/3/8_vqtO0VsAp.png)*Dev Quotes*

Next, we will create another similar mozilla extension called **Drink Some Water**. As the name suggests, it will send remainder to drink some water every 2 hours.

So, go ahead and create a folder **DrinkSomeWater** and inside it another folder **icons**. Inside that folder place an icon and name it **icon.png**

Now, create a file **manifest.json** inside the folder **DrinkSomeWater** and put the below content in it.

![manifest.json](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/FirefoxAddons/3/9_GBpNEr2ZXb.png)*manifest.json*

Next, create a file **background.js** and put the below content in it. It is more simpler than the earlier addons, as it shows only one quote.

![background.js](https://ik.imagekit.io/thewebdev/FirefoxAddons/3/10_wxb3cgaqts.png)*background.js*

Again will to publish this addon to the mozilla addon store and will follow the procedure explained in [part-2](https://medium.com/@nabendu82/creating-firefox-browser-extensions-2-ddf1f236f401) of this series.

I had followed the procedure and submitted the firefox extension and it is **Awaiting Review** now.

This complete part-3 of the series. You can find the code for the same in my github account [here](https://github.com/nabendu82/Addons).
