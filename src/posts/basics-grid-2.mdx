Welcome to part-2 of the series. Let me start with the dev tools which are really beneficial for development in Grid. By the time of writing, still **Firefox developer edition** have the best tool to auto-detect Grid.

Grids are a very visual thing and there are **implicit track** and **explicit track**, which are shown beautifully in latest Firefox developer edition.

Let use the [codepen](https://codepen.io/nabendu82/full/zJddGM/) from last tutorial to demonstrate this.

I have opened the codepen and then **right-clicked** and **Inspect Element** on Firefox developer edition, to show me the developer tools. This is similar to the developer tool of Chrome or other browser, but have an additional section on the right side. Notice there is a Layout and that is the main tool to work in Grid.

There is a main grid in our code(which we will look next), called the **container**. I have selected it. Also there was a circle with yellow color(as in above screenshot), select that and make it black or any dark color. Also, make sure all three **Grid Display Settings** checkboxes are selected.

Now the code for the above grid is below. *We have two grid columns and three grid rows.*
```
    <div class="container">
        <div class="item">1</div>
        <div class="item">2</div>
        <div class="item">3</div>
        <div class="item">4</div>
        <div class="item">5</div>
        <div class="item">6</div>
        <div class="item">7</div>
        <div class="item">8</div>
        <div class="item">9</div>
        <div class="item">10</div>
    </div>
    <style>
        .container {
            display: grid;
            grid-template-columns: 200px 500px;
            grid-template-rows: 100px 50px 200px;
            grid-gap: 5px;
        }
    </style>
```
Let look at **implicit tracks** and **explicit tracks** now. I have zoomed in the browser and we are between 1 and 3 items. The **explicit tracks** are marked as dashed lines (— — — —) and are called **explicit** as they are created because we declared them using *grid-template-columns* and *grid-template-rows*.

![The explicit track](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5760/1*KUzhSb7xQNsIQOx4NbjznA.png)*The explicit track*

The **implicit tracks** are marked by dotted line(……..) and they are called implicit because they created by the Grid system. We only have three rows because of *grid-template-rows: 100px 50px 200px;*
The last 2 rows are **implicit** because we didn’t defined them.

![The Implicit track](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5760/1*kGDGCTEuDy8Tjlj4Mhk6Qw.png)*The Implicit track*

These implicit tracks by default takes the height of the element inside it. As, in this case it takes the digit 7 , 8 , 9 and 10 height. We can change that by a property known as **grid-auto-rows**, which is the size of all implicit rows.
```
    .container {
            display: grid;
            grid-template-columns: 200px 500px;
            grid-template-rows: 100px 50px 200px;
            grid-auto-rows: 150px;
            grid-gap: 5px;
        }
```
Now the two implicit rows are 150px each.

Auto Flow — By default any implicit track is created in the next row. We can change it by **grid-auto-flow** property.

We will use this [codepen](https://codepen.io/nabendu82/full/PdJKjG/) for grid-auto-flow. First we are having this basic code. It have *two columns and two items*, so both are explicit and placed accordingly.
```
    <div class="container">
        <div class="item">1</div>
        <div class="item">2</div>

    </div>
    <style>
        .container {
            display: grid;
            grid-template-columns: 400px 200px;
            grid-gap: 15px;
        }
    </style>
```
![The result](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5752/1*NZ6OOSRps3acDrLI18P-RQ.png)*The result*

Now if we have a third item in this setup, it will go below item 1. This implicit item follow the property *grid-auto-flow: row* which is the default option and we don’t have to mention it.
```
    <div class="container">
        <div class="item">1</div>
        <div class="item">2</div>
        <div class="item">3</div>

    </div>
    <style>
        .container {
            display: grid;
            grid-template-columns: 400px 200px;
            grid-gap: 15px;
        }
    </style>
```
![The result](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5760/1*O3VB8w-W3esh4x7Uj23_oQ.png)*The result*

Now in the same above layout, if we give *grid-auto-flow: column* then the implicit item 3 will be placed beside item 2.
```
    <div class="container">
        <div class="item">1</div>
        <div class="item">2</div>
        <div class="item">3</div>

    </div>
    <style>
        .container {
            display: grid;
            grid-template-columns: 400px 200px;
            grid-auto-flow: column;
            grid-gap: 15px;
        }
    </style>
```

This concludes part-2 of the series.
