I had recently started my YouTube channel — The Web Dev. I had decided to start putting all my blogs into the YouTube channel.

We will create an web app from scratch using ReactJS, which will consume the Unsplash API. We can search for any image from unsplash.com and it will show them.

Here is the second part of the series.

<div className={styles.image__small}>
